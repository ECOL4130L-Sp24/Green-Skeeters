# Effects of climate on viral disease prevalence in mosquitoes in four US sites

## Project Description
We seek to use NEON data to understand how climate influences viral vector-borne disease dynamics across the United States. Previous modeling predicts range expansion in mosquitoes in a rapidly warming climate, which could significantly alter viral dynamics. This effect is compounded by rapid and pervasive global travel. We hypothesize that warmer climates, which encourage mosquito breeding and virus replication, will generate a higher prevalence of viral disease in mosquitoes.

## Data and Methodology
To test this hypothesis, we plan to use air temperature data along with mosquito viral testing data from NEON sites FL-DSNY, MA-HARV, ND-WOOD, and UT-MOAB from April 2016 to October 2022. Because viral prevalence data does not exist on a large enough temporal scale to accurately determine the effect of climate change over time, we use a "space-for-time" substitution and sample sites across a latitudinal gradient.
