# Effects of climate on viral disease prevalence in mosquitoes and rodents in four US sites

## Project Description
We seek to use NEON data to understand how climate influences viral vector-borne disease dynamics across the United States. Previous modeling predicts range expansion in both mosquitoes and rodents in a rapidly warming climate, which could significantly alter viral dynamics. This effect is compounded by rapid and pervasive global travel. We hypothesize that warmer climates will see higher prevalence of viral disease in both rodents and mosquitoes, but due to the high prevalence of hantavirus in the western United States, we also expect rodents to have higher prevalence in western sites. 

## Data and Methodology
To test this hypothesis, we plan to use air temperature data along with rodent and mosquito viral testing data from NEON sites FL-DSNY, MA-HARV, ND-WOOD, and UT-MOAB in June 2019. Because viral prevalence data does not exist on a large enough temporal scale to accurately determine the effect of climate change over time, we use a "space-for-time" substitution and sample sites across a latitudinal gradient.
